dimensions for A * x in "vector" mode:

[dim(2) (L)]
reshape in mtimes
[dim(2) *L]
iembed

[idim *L]
forw (assuming 'does_many') - this is what the user routine must consider
[odim *L]

reshape to [prod(odim) *L] in mtimes
oselect
[dim(1) *L]
reshape in mtimes
[dim(1) (L)]

usually iembed(x) is just embed(x, mask)
usually oselect(y) is just y

A' * y is the same execpt we swap
dim -> [dim(2) dim(1)]
iembed <-> oembed
forw <-> back
iselect <-> oselect
idim <-> odim

usually oembed(y) is just reshape(y, [odim *L])
usually iselect(x) is just x(mask(:),:)
