This directory has C-code for 1D, 2D, and 3D interpolation
(aka "gridding") using finite-support kernels that are tabulated
on a fine grid.

To compile for octave use "make -f Makefile-oct"

The code supports interpolation using a complex kernel because
my original NUFFT implementation required this generality.
The complex interpolator code supports only 0th-order interpolation,
where one looks up the nearest value in the kernel table.

However, I later realized that a real kernel suffices as long
as appropriate phase factors are applied before and after the
interpolation.  So in July 2008 I added support for real kernels,
and for those one has the option of either 0th-order or 1st-order
interpolation of the values in the kernel table.  Using 1st-order
interpolation requires slightly more computation, but allows one
to use a smaller table.  And often modern CPUs are limited by memory
bandwidth, not by simple calculations, so 1st-order is probably
preferable.

For discussion of using 1st-order interpolation, see Beatty etal,
