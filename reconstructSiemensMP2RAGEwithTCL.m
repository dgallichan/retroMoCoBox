% function reconstructSiemensMP2RAGEwithTCL(rawDataFile,TCLdir,varargin)
% 
%
% Usage:
%%%%%%%%
%
% 'rawDataFile' - this is the filename for the raw data you exported from
%                 TWIX (including the full path). Due to the way I chose to
%                 name output files, if you have renamed the datafile it is
%                 required to still contain the text 'MID' followed by a
%                 number and then an underscore ('_') so that multiple
%                 files can be processed from the same directory and not
%                 get overwritten.
%
% 'TCLdir' - this is the folder containing the TCL (TracInnovations
%            Tracoline system) logging information from the same scan
%            session.
%
%
%  Optional arguments:-
%      'TCLtimeOffset_ms' - manually specify time offset between TCL clock
%                           and raw data of MP2RAGE scan
%
%      'outRoot' - this gets used as the output folder for all processing
%                 (and the default root for the temporary folder which may
%                 generate several Gb of temporary files along the way - 
%                 - override this with 'tempRoot' option). The default 
%                 'outRoot' is to use the same folder as the raw data file.
%    
%      'tempRoot' - location for creating temporary files - can be many Gb.
%                   Default is to use the same location as 'outRoot'.
%
%      'bLinParSwap' - set this to '1' to indicate that the 'LIN/PAR swap'
%                     option was chosen in the MP2RAGE sequence. This
%                     alters which direction in k-space the FatNavs
%                     correspond to.
%
%      'bGRAPPAinRAM' - set this to '1' to perform the GRAPPA recon (if
%                       necessary!) for the host sequence entirely in RAM. This
%                       can be quite a lot faster - but requires sufficient
%                       RAM...! 
%                       (Note that the temporary variables for applying the
%                       MoCo are currently done outside of RAM as this
%                       is currently not the bottleneck for that part of
%                       the recon)
%
%      'bKeepGRAPPArecon' - set this to '1' to prevent deleting of the
%                           GRAPPA recon of the host data (which would be
%                           deleted by default). 
%
%      'bKeepReconInRAM' - set this to '1' to keep all the reconstructed
%                          files (INV1, INV2 and UNI, all with and without
%                          correction) in RAM, or default is to use a
%                          temporary file.
%
%      'bFullParforRecon' - set this to '1' to enable parfor over the NUFFT
%                           loop. For this to work, bKeepReconInRAM must
%                           also be set - and depending how many CPUs you
%                           have available on your matlabpool, you may need
%                           to have LOADS of RAM...  But it is much faster!
%       
%      'coilCombineMethod' - In MP2RAGE the default method is to match what
%                            I believe is done on the scanner - to weight
%                            each separately calculated UNI image by the
%                            square of the INV2 image for that coil.
%                            Slightly better results might be obtained for
%                            low SNR data by using a lower-res version of
%                            the INV2 image. Set this option to 'lowres' to
%                            try this. 
%                            For INV1 and INV2 the default is to combine
%                            the images using root sum-of-squares
%                            - this is not optimal, so the 'lowres' will
%                            also try to use a low-res version of INV2 to
%                            combine both. This corresponds to the coil
%                            combination method of Bydder et al, MRM 2002,
%                            47:539-548 - but as there is a smoothness
%                            parameter which needs tuning - and that it can
%                            also lead to signal voids, I haven't yet felt
%                            confident enough to make this the default
%                            processing.
%
%       'swapDims_xyz' - 3-component row-vector to determine whether to
%                        reverse each of x, y and z directions. Default is
%                        [0 0 1] which seems to work for a lot of parameter
%                        sets, but not all...  Check the orientation
%                        checker feature in the HTML!
%
%       'bZipNIFTIs' - Use '1' to apply gzip at the end to all the NIFTI
%                     files (default), otherwise just leave them uncompressed.
%
%       'bKeepPatientInfo' - Use '1' to keep sensitive info from raw data header  
%                           in HTML output (default). Use '0' to anomyize completely
%                           and use a string e.g. '0019' to insert the ID from
%                           another database.
%
%       'GRAPPAlambda' - regularization for GRAPPA weights for MPRAGE
%                        recon. Default is zero, but for large motion may
%                        want to use 1e-2 or so.
%
%       'pSmoothMPars' - factor to smooth the TCL motion parameters by -
%                        corresponds to 'p' in csaps.m help

%           This is used to perform the NUFFT 3D gridding operation used to deal

%           been applied.

%           For reading in the Siemens raw data format - and able to handle
%           very large datasets elegantly. 
%           I made small changes to the code to allow handling of the
%           FatNav data. For the TCL data, certain properties of my modified 
%           version are also used, despite having no FatNavs.
%     NIFTI Tools (from Jimmy Shen)
%           For reading in and saving out in the .nii NIFTI format. 
%           This code is provided here unaltered.

%     GCC - coil compression (from Miki Lustig)
%           We work mostly with a 32-channel head coil, and so massive
%           speedups are possible when using coil compression. This code
%           from Miki Lustig's website implements the method described in
%           Zhang et. al MRM 2013;69(2):571-82.
%           For this code I have directly taken snippets and inserted them
%           into performHostGRAPPArecon.m
% 
%     export_fig (from Oliver Woodford)
%           Useful for making figures that you save from Matlab look nice!
%           :)
%
%     process_options (from Mark A. Paskin)
%           Useful for sending optional inputs to this master file.         
%
%     subplot1 (from Eran O. Ofek)
%           Nicer than Matlab's own way of doing subplots
%

% Optional:
%     ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org)
%           For making animated GIFs of results ('convert') in the html

%
%     FSL (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) - tested with v5.0
%           Used for brain extraction ('bet') in order to make MIP views 
%           of INV2 images (which show bright arteries) more interpretable
