%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Whereas run_retroMoCoDemo.m uses real example data acquired with a pulse
% sequence with FatNavs inserted into it to demonstrate the
% motion-correction, this script uses the retroMoCoBox to simulate
% motion-corrupted data - and then see how well the corrupted k-space data
% can be fixed by applying the known translations and rotations.
%
% This can't be considered a 'full' simulation of the artifacts caused by
% motion - as it makes a number of simplifying assumptions - but it should
% give a good indication of the upper limit of the quality of a
% retrospective motion-correction when the motion-parameters are known
% precisely (which for any real acquisition they will not be - and for a
% FatNav acquisition the motion parameters will necessarily not correspond
% exactly in time to when the k-space data for the main sequence were
% acquired).
%
% It's probably easiest to run this script cell-by-cell so that you can
% keep track of what's going on. The default settings should demonstrate
% that even for quite considerable motion, the single-step retrospective
% correction can do a good job if the motion-parameters are known exactly.
%
% The script lets you experiment with various types of motion profiles -
% with simple models for swallowing artifacts and sudden jerky movements.
% You can also vary the 'baseline' noise. If you change this from the
% 'smoother' motion (default) to the '*really* rough motion' you should
% find that although the motion-corrected version is reasonably sharp,
% there is still quite a lot of residual ringing artifact. This residual
% ringing can be reduced considerably by an iterative version of the
% reconstruction - but this is *much* slower, so should only be attempted
% on a reasonably small test volume (easiest to achieve by uncommenting the
% line in the next cell which will extract just a thin slab in the z
% direction). The iterative reconstruction massively reduces the ringing
% artifact, but still leaves a small textural artifact. It is an ongoing
% area of research as to what extent the iterative reconstruction can be
% used on real data.
%
%
% Suggested ways to play around with this script:
%
% 1. Just run through the example as it is, and check what is
%    happening at each stage.
%
% 2. Experiment with different motion profiles:
%      - change the 'noiseBasePars' to the other commented lines to see
%        generalised changes with overall noise pattern
%      - look at the differences in correction when there are only
%        translations or only rotations (you should find that pure translations
%        are - in this simulation setting - perfectly reversible)
%      - explore the kinds of image artifacts that arise due to different
%        kinds of motion - parameters are already included for
%        swallowing-like motion and random sudden movements
%
% 3. With the 'noiseBasePars' set to the *really* rough motion option, you
%    will probably find that even the NUFFT reconstruction looks rather
%    disappointing. This is because a complete correction requires an
%    iterative approach, rather than a single application of the NUFFT
%    adjoint operator. 
%    You can explore the improvement using an iterative NUFFT by first making 
%    sure that the volume you are working on is quite small (to keep the 
%    computation reasonably fast). I did this by extracting only a thin
%    slab of the full 3D example volume. Then run through the whole script
%    as it is - and then uncomment the iterative recon cell in this file 
%    and run that. It peforms 10 conjugate-gradient iterations and should 
%    give a much improved result.
%
% 4. A common concern people have regarding retrospective motion-correction
%    is the handling of 'holes' in k-space which occur following sudden
%    motion. This is easiest to simulate by uncommenting the lines in the
%    cell generating the motion-parameters that will give one single large
%    rotation. 
%    My interpretation of the result of this is that the retrospective
%    reconstruction is remarkably robust to such a hole in k-space. If you
%    uncomment the lines for comparing the k-spaces you can see both the
%    hole this creates - as well as the source of error where data overlap.
%    In this case, the iterative reconstruction is able to improve things
%    slightly - reducing the artifact due to the overlapping k-space - but
%    to 'fill-in' the hole would presumably require a reconstruction that
%    makes use of k-space symmetry, or utilizes parallel imaging.
%
% 5. The single-step NUFFT adjoint operation can be improved if 'density
%    compensation' is properly accounted for. When rotations have occurred in
%    k-space and then been undone, the overlapping can be compensated for
%    by scaling down and sparser sampled regions should be scaled down.
%    Uncomment the density compensation cell to experiment with this.
%    You should find that the single rotation tested in example 4 above can
%    be well-compensated by simple density compensation. However, if you go
%    back to the rough noise example, you will find that the density
%    compensation does not work properly. This is presumably because
%    calculating the 'real' density compensation function that should be
%    used is a difficult problem in itself.
%    In my experience of real data, applying density compensation in this
%    way rarely makes a noticeably difference to the image - and in cases
%    where there is residual image artifact following the NUFFT adjoint
%    operation it is typically very difficult to estimate a reliable
%    density compensation function. For this reason density compensation is
%    currently omitted from the retroMoCoBox pipelines.
