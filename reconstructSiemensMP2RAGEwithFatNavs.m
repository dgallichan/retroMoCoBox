% Dependencies:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  %% Required %%:
%
%     SPM 12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) 
%           For coregistration of FatNavs ('spm_realign').
%           This is obviously core to the concept of FatNavs for
%           motion-correction. I have tried using alternative registration
%           software, but SPM appears to have default parameters which work
%           well for FatNavs - being particular sensitive to sub-voxel
%           movements.
%
% Usage:
%%%%%%%%
%
% 'rawDataFile' - this is the filename for the raw data you exported from
%                 TWIX (including the full path). Due to the way I chose to
%                 name output files, if you have renamed the datafile it is
%                 required to still contain the text 'MID' followed by a
%                 number and then an underscore ('_') so that multiple
%                 files can be processed from the same directory and not
%                 get overwritten.
%
%  Optional arguments:-
%      'outRoot' - this gets used as the output folder for all processing
%                 (and the default root for the temporary folder which may
%                 generate several Gb of temporary files along the way - 
%                 - override this with 'tempRoot' option). The default 
%                 'outRoot' is to use the same folder as the raw data file.
%    
%      'tempRoot' - location for creating temporary files - can be many Gb.
%                   Default is to use the same location as 'outRoot'.
%
%      'bLinParSwap' - set this to '1' to indicate that the 'LIN/PAR swap'
%                     option was chosen in the MP2RAGE sequence. This
%                     alters which direction in k-space the FatNavs
%                     correspond to.
%
%      'bGRAPPAinRAM' - set this to '1' to perform the GRAPPA recon (if
%                       necessary!) for the host sequence entirely in RAM. This
%                       can be quite a lot faster - but requires sufficient
%                       RAM...! 
%                       (Note that the temporary variables for applying the
%                       MoCo are currently done outside of RAM as this
%                       is currently not the bottleneck for that part of
%                       the recon)
%
%      'bKeepGRAPPArecon' - set this to '1' to prevent deleting of the
%                           GRAPPA recon of the host data (which would be
%                           deleted by default). 
%
%      'bKeepReconInRAM' - set this to '1' to keep all the reconstructed
%                          files (INV1, INV2 and UNI, all with and without
%                          correction) in RAM, or default is to use a
%                          temporary file.
%
%      'bFullParforRecon' - set this to '1' to enable parfor over the NUFFT
%                           loop. For this to work, bKeepReconInRAM must
%                           also be set - and depending how many CPUs you
%                           have available on your matlabpool, you may need
%                           to have LOADS of RAM...  But it is much faster!
%       
%      'coilCombineMethod' - In MP2RAGE the default method is to match what
%                            I believe is done on the scanner - to weight
%                            each separately calculated UNI image by the
%                            square of the INV2 image for that coil.
%                            Slightly better results might be obtained for
%                            low SNR data by using a lower-res version of
%                            the INV2 image. Set this option to 'lowres' to
%                            try this. 
%                            For INV1 and INV2 the default is to combine
%                            the images using root sum-of-squares
%                            - this is not optimal, so the 'lowres' will
%                            also try to use a low-res version of INV2 to
%                            combine both. This corresponds to the coil
%                            combination method of Bydder et al, MRM 2002,
%                            47:539-548 - but as there is a smoothness
%                            parameter which needs tuning - and that it can
%                            also lead to signal voids, I haven't yet felt
%                            confident enough to make this the default
%                            processing.
%
%       'FatNavRes_mm' - the spatial resolution of the acquired FatNavs, 
%                        specified in mm. The current implementation of the
%                        pulse sequence does not allow this information to
%                        be stored in the raw data, so this must be entered
%                        here manually - or use the default of 2 mm.
%                        Whatever you specify here, the code does still
%                        assume that the acceleration for the FatNavs was
%                        4x4 and that the FOV was 176x256x256mm.
%
%       'swapDims_xyz' - 3-component row-vector to determine whether to
%                        reverse each of x, y and z directions. Default is
%                        [0 0 1] which seems to work for a lot of parameter
%                        sets, but not all...  Check the orientation
%                        checker feature in the HTML!
%
%       'bZipNIFTIs' - Use '1' to apply gzip at the end to all the NIFTI
%                     files (default), otherwise just leave them uncompressed.
%
%       'bKeepFatNavs' - Use '1' to keep all the reconstructed FatNavs,
%                       otherwise delete that folder when finished
%                       (default).
%
%       'bKeepPatientInfo' - Use '1' to keep sensitive info from raw data header  
%                           in HTML output (default). Use '0' to anomyize completely
%                           and use a string e.g. '0019' to insert the ID from
%                           another database.
%
%       'bKeepComplexImageData' - save out the complex data per coil as MATLAB files 
%                                 before and after application of MoCo.

% Matlab tools which are included:
%
%     NUFFT code from the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT)
%     (http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html)
%     from the group of Prof. J Fessler
%           This is used to perform the NUFFT 3D gridding operation used to deal
%           with the non-Cartesian k-space sampling after rotations have
%           been applied.
%
%     mapVBVD (from Philip Ehses) 
% *** Note that this code is presumably 'Siemens-sensitive' as it is    ***
% *** not freely available online, but only from the Siemens user forum.***
% *** Consequently the FatNavs recon code must also be considered       ***
% *** 'Siemens-sensitive' while it contains this code                   ***
% *** I have not included this part in the Github repository - please   ***
% *** email me if you would like it.                                    ***
%           For reading in the Siemens raw data format - and able to handle
%           very large datasets elegantly. 
%           I made small changes to the code to allow handling of the
%           FatNav data.
%
%     NIFTI Tools (from Jimmy Shen)
%           For reading in and saving out in the .nii NIFTI format. 
%           This code is provided here unaltered.            
%
%     GCC - coil compression (from Miki Lustig)
%           We work mostly with a 32-channel head coil, and so massive
%           speedups are possible when using coil compression. This code
%           from Miki Lustig's website implements the method described in
%           Zhang et. al MRM 2013;69(2):571-82.
%           For this code I have directly taken snippets and inserted them
%           into performHostGRAPPArecon.m
% 
%     export_fig (from Oliver Woodford)
%           Useful for making figures that you save from Matlab look nice!
%           :)
%
%     process_options (from Mark A. Paskin)
%           Useful for sending optional inputs to this master file.         
%
%     subplot1 (from Eran O. Ofek)
%           Nicer than Matlab's own way of doing subplots
%
% 
% Optional:
%     ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org)
%           For making animated GIFs of results ('convert') in the html
%           report
%
%     FSL (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) - tested with v5.0
%           Used for brain extraction ('bet') in order to make MIP views 
%           of INV2 images (which show bright arteries) more interpretable
%
%
%
%
%
% To do:
%%%%%%%%
%
%  Coil compression for the FatNavs
%              - this is now implemented, but preliminary tests have shown
%                it doesn't work well... One problem is the weights
%                themselves for the sparse image - the other problem is
%                that acceleration of 16 is quite a lot...
%
%  Coil compression when no GRAPPA used
%              - this might make sense to still be able to speed up the
%                application of the retrospective motion-correction, but as
%                most people are probably scanning with GRAPPA in the host
%                sequence anyway, I haven't implemented this yet.

%   v0.4 -   -- August 2016
%        - changed default NUFFT oversampling from 1.375 to 1.5 (to reduce aliasing artifact)
%   v0.5 -   -- September 2016
%        - updated to latest version of Philipp Ehses' mapVBVD software (from 18/9/15)
%        - now renamed things to make it part of the 'RetroMoCoBox' and put
%          on Github
%        - Added the bFullParforRecon option to really speed things up if
%          you have enough CPUs and RAM available
%        - changed name of bKeepRecoInRAM to bKeepReconInRAM for consistency
%        - output files no longer start with 'a_host_'
%        - fit to versioning for the whole of 'RetroMoCoBox' as 0.5.0
%        
%   0.5.1 -  -- September 2016
%         - Fixed bug in handling of data acquired without GRAPPA
%         - Fixed bug in handling of data acquired with different orientations 
%
%   0.6.0 -  -- February 2017 - new contact email: gallichand@cardiff.ac.uk

%
%   0.7.0 - Feb 2018
%         - Create sub-function reconstructSiemensVolume.m so that multiple
%           averages or repetitions can be handled directly in this code.
%           NB. Handling this properly would involve updated the sequence
%           code run on the scanner because it currently doesn't label the
%           FatNavs properly beyond the first volume of the host. This
%           feature probably won't be used enough to make that worthwhile
%           though...
%         - WARNING - I took this opportunity to cleanup the names of some
%           of the input options (always putting a 'b' for boolean in front
%           of logical options) so please check your calling code!
%
%
%   0.7.1 - -- Nov 2018
%         - Added new input flag 'bKeepComplexImageData' to allow saving
%           out of the complex data per coil as MATLAB files - before and
%           after application of MoCo.
